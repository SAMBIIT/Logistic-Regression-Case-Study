# Logistic-Regression-Case-Study

#### Client- 
XEducation company which sells online courses to industry professionals.
The company markets its courses on several websites, google search engine, etc. Once people land on the their website, they might browse a course or watch some videos or even fill up a form for a course they are interested in.When people fill up the form giving details like Ph no, emailid, choice of course etc, they are classified as a lead. Then the sales team gets into touch with them via calls & emails, nurtures them about courses, syllabus, structure of the course and fee structure in order to guide them into buying the right course for them. And this is the process how leads get converted. 

#### Problem Statement- 
Lead convertion rate in 30% only. And the company wants the lead convertion process to be more efficient.

#### Logistic Regression Model Objective-
Improving the lead convertion rate from 30% to 80% by filtering out incoming leads into hot & cold leads. Where hot lead means leads having high chances of getting converted. So that sales team can target only the hot leads.
